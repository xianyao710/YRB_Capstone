#What we have right now
1.Wrapped codes of our work flow to test CAGE data
2. CAGE data of maize shoots and roots, each has two biological replicate
3. Mapping of CAGE reads against reference maize genome,
bam file

#Whats next
1.Use Taylor's workflow to extract promoter regions from reference genome, then implement our work flow to identify non-redundant motifs.

2.Daily update of the manuscripts with proper citations.
